## About
A sample application to show how to use CharacterController as a non module library, in otherwords load it using just script tags rather than using some module system.


The dependencies have been manually downloaded and stored in the lib folder.  
Instead of manually downloading you could,  
use npm to download these dependencies and use script tags to point to them inside the "node_modules" folder or  
use cdn urls in script tages  

The dependencies needed are 
* babylonjs
* babylonjs-chractercontroller

## Run
Run an http server and open index.html in browser.
